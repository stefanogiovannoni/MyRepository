                learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of

        <h3><strong>General Information</strong></h3>
            <p>The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing 
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a 
                member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside
                neighborhood. MDHL ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of 
                parents and previous league members
